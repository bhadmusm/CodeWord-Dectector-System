This is a CodeWord Detector System created for a Digital System Design Project. The system was created with verilog on the Viviado software and targeted to the Basys 3 FPGA Board.
The system is comprised of a LFSR, a sequence detecting FSM, and a counter that counts the number of times a specific codeword is detected in the stream of bits generated by the LFSR in a full cycle.
The files ending in "_TB" were used to test and validate the design.
